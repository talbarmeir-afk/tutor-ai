# Show your work — math mistake finder

Upload a photo of handwritten math work. AI finds the first mistake, draws a
red-pen-style arrow at it, explains what went wrong, and answers follow-up
questions.

## How it's structured

- `index.html` — the frontend (static, no build step)
- `lib/anthropic.js` — shared logic for calling the Anthropic API
- `api/*.js` — serverless functions for **Vercel**
- `netlify/functions/*.js` — the same two endpoints for **Netlify**
- `netlify.toml` — maps `/api/*` to Netlify's function paths so the same
  frontend code works on either platform unchanged

The API key never reaches the browser — the frontend calls `/api/analyze`
and `/api/ask` on your own domain, and those functions call Anthropic
server-side using an environment variable.

## Local development

You'll need a free Anthropic API key: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and paste your key in place of sk-ant-...
```

Then run either platform's CLI dev server (installs nothing globally beyond
the CLI itself):

```bash
# Vercel
npx vercel dev

# or Netlify
npx netlify dev
```

Both serve the site at a local URL with `/api/*` wired up to the functions.

## Deploying

See the deployment walkthrough your assistant gave you, or in short:
push this repo to GitHub, import it in Vercel or Netlify, and set
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as an environment variable in the project's dashboard.
