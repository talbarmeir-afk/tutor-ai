# Show your work — math mistake finder

Upload a photo of handwritten math work, or let your camera watch as you
write. AI finds the first mistake, draws a red-pen-style arrow at it,
explains what went wrong, and answers follow-up questions.

## How it's structured

- `index.html` — the frontend (static, no build step)
- `lib/anthropic.js` — shared logic for calling the Anthropic API
- `api/*.js` — serverless functions for **Vercel**
- `netlify/functions/*.js` — the same three endpoints for **Netlify**
- `netlify.toml` — maps `/api/*` to Netlify's function paths so the same
  frontend code works on either platform unchanged

The API key never reaches the browser — the frontend calls `/api/analyze`,
`/api/ask`, and `/api/watch` on your own domain, and those functions call
Anthropic server-side using an environment variable.

### Watch mode

"Watch with camera" isn't literal live video analysis — Claude's vision API
can't stream frame-by-frame. Instead, the browser samples the camera feed
client-side to detect a writing-then-pause pattern (motion, then ~1.5s of
stillness), and only then captures a frame and sends it to `/api/watch`.
That endpoint is stateless like the others; the browser tracks a small
`priorState` (the last confirmed-correct line, and any still-unresolved
flagged mistake) and sends it with each check so the model only evaluates
what's new since the last check, rather than re-reading the whole page each
time. See the constants at the top of the "Watch mode" section in
`index.html` (`MOTION_STABLE_MS`, `MIN_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`, etc.) if checks
fire too eagerly or too late for your setup — they're tuned starting points,
not fixed values.

## Local development

You'll need a free Anthropic API key: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and paste your key in place of sk-ant-...
```

Then run either platform's CLI dev server (installs nothing globally beyond
the CLI itself):

```bash
# Vercel
npx vercel dev

# or Netlify
npx netlify dev
```

Both serve the site at a local URL with `/api/*` wired up to the functions.

## Deploying

See the deployment walkthrough your assistant gave you, or in short:
push this repo to GitHub, import it in Vercel or Netlify, and set
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as an environment variable in the project's dashboard.
